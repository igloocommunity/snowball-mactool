This tool allows one to change (permanently) the MAC address       
of the SMSC 9221 Ethernet controller of Snowball boards.

The address is written to the EEPROM of the controller to persist
over reboots.

To build the tool simply run

 $ make
 
assuming you have a cross-compiler set in your path. By default
the compiler is expected to be "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc", but if
you want/need to use some other cross-compiler you can do so by
redefining $CC on the command line:

 $ make CC=my-funny-toolchain-gcc

This will produce a statically linked binary that should be
usable in almost any kind of image available for Snowball.
